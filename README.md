# ensemble_method
Ensemble Method project

The aim of this project was to predict the number of unit sold for given products. Those products came form the website Alibaba. 
With this project, we were able to perform a classification task on the number of units sold for each product, given some dependent features.

We first created a data preprocessing step, that consisted in working on feature engineering, creating more relevant features, dealing with missing values as well as categorical features for instance.

Then we trained and compared different models and ensemble methods to perform the classification task. After computing some performance metrics, we were able to identify an optimal model (Stacking, closely followed by Random Forest and XGBoost).

In the end, we used Feature Importances and Shapley Values to interpret our model mechanism and outputs.
